# TiltDrawer
Just a little application where you draw on a platform with a marble using simple fluid mechanic principles like friction, surface roughness, viscocity, and surface tension.

Honestly, the planning, concept, and code are the more interesting components of the project. I'm hoping to revist this in a few months and revive the repo to give it an appropriatly impressive visual upgrade to match the project
